    <h1 align="center"> PROJECT: UDEMY AND THE SUCCESS IN SALES OF ITS COURSES. PREDICTION USING PYTHON </h1>
</div>



## A. DATASET INFORMATION

### Context

- Udemy (www.udemy.com) is an online marketplace that offers distance learning courses on various topics related to technology and business. The site operates as a marketplace where instructors can publish the courses they have developed and earn money when any Udemy student purchases them.
- The number of Udemy courses has grown rapidly due to the success of distance education. However, the courses have had very diverse demands; some have been bestsellers while others have had so few students that they do not justify the investment made in them.

### Project Objective
**The ultimate goal is to predict which of the courses to be launched in 2023 will be bestsellers, through the analysis of data from courses published in Spanish between 2012 and 2022.**
