    <h1 align="center"> PROJECT: UDEMY AND THE SUCCESS IN SALES OF ITS COURSES. PREDICTION USING PYTHON </h1>
</div>



## A. DATASET INFORMATION

### A.1. CONTEXT

- *Udemy* (www.udemy.com) is an online marketplace that offers distance learning courses on various topics related to technology and business. The site operates as a marketplace where instructors can publish the courses they have developed and earn money when any *Udemy* student purchases them.
- The number of *Udemy* courses has grown rapidly due to the success of distance education. However, the courses have had very diverse demands; some have been bestsellers while others have had so few students that they do not justify the investment made in them.

### A.2. PROJECT OBJETIVE
**The ultimate goal is to predict which of the courses to be launched in 2023 will be *bestsellers*, through the analysis of data from courses published in Spanish between 2012 and 2022.**

## B. ABOUT THE PROJECT DOCUMENTATION 

### B.1. HOW TO READ THE DOCUMENTATION? 

- Read the file named "Project_Final_Udemy.ipynb" where you can visualize the Python code in Google Colaboratory.
- Within the Python code, you will find an organized outline with interpretations and analyses developed.
